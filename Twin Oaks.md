# Twin Oaks

A 100 person community on 450 acres in rural Virginia founded in 1967. Founded during a wave of communitarian enthusiam and experimentation in the 60s, like many intentional communities, it faced many initial challenges (lack of resources, high turnover of members, interpersonal conflicts). However, it survived and is thriving today with a significant waiting list as of the mid 2020s.
