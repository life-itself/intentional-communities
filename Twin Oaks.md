# Twin Oaks

A 100 person community on 450 acres in rural Virginia founded in 1967. Founded during a wave of communitarian enthusiam and experimentation in the 60s, like many intentional communities, it faced many initial challenges (lack of resources, high turnover of members, interpersonal conflicts). However, it survived and is thriving today with a significant waiting list as of the mid 2020s.

Original inspiration from [[Walden Two]]

## Good info on relation to Walden Two and early history of community

> Twin Oaks Intentional Community was founded in 1967 based on the behaviorist principles of BF Skinner's book Walden Two. We are no longer a behaviorist community, but it is here that our roots lie, and so we are including this information on our website. Note that Twin Oaks does retain some of it's Walden Two roots: the labor system and planner/manager decision-making system were important elements in Walden Two and are still central to life at Twin Oaks (current information, year 2010).

Whole bunch more further down that doc. Big point that Twin Oaks started without much money and this was a big issue - and something completely missing in the discussion in Walden Two book.
