It is noteworthy for being the major other Walden two Community other than Twinoaks, and more exactly following the more interesting aspects of Walden 2 than Twin Oaks eg in its use of behaviour ology and explicit focus on rapid iterative cultural evolution.

> How did Los Horcones community started?

In October of 1973, a group of 7 people (some of us behavioral psychologists) interested in the prevention and solution of personal and social problems, founded the Los Horcones community in the suburbs of Hermosillo,Sonora in northwestern Mexico. See Location.See History of Los Horcones.

Our objective was and still is to design and develop here and now, an alternative society or culture based on the principles of cooperation,equality, pacifism (non-violence), sharing and ecological respect (ecological sustainability).

In short, Los Horcones' goal is to build a humanistic communitarian society*, where every one can develop our own potentialities as unique individuals and help others to do it.

* We define a communitarian humanistic society as one where members work in cooperation toward the same objectives or ideals (communal goals). One where members share property (reducing in this way economic differences between members). A society where members participate in decisions making and do not delegate their responsibilities to others. One where members care for each other and get along well with each other. Where members solve personal conflicts and community problems in pacifist (non-violent ways).
